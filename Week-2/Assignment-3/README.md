# Assignment 3: Data Manipulation
1. count: return an object which shows the count of each character.
2. groupByKey: return an object which shows the summed-up value of each key.
This time, you may get letters from ‘a’ to ‘z’, try to avoid using ‘if’ or ‘switch’ to split each letter into different cases (e.g. if(letter == ‘a’) {...} else if (letter == ‘b’) {...} ), otherwise, your code will be very long.
Note:
1. The input format is different for these two functions.
2. In the second function, the input may have the same key but different values, the
output should have each key only once.
