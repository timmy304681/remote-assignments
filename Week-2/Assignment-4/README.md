# Assignment 4: HTML DOM and Event Handling
Following the assignment in week 1, letâ€™s add some effects on it by only pure JavaScript without Bootstrap, JQuery, or any other libraries.

## Request 1: Click to Change Text.
When the user clicks on the "Welcome Message" block, change the text to "Have a Good Time!".

## Request 2: Click to Show More Content Boxes.
There are some more content boxes waiting to show. When the user clicks the Call-to-Action button, show those hidden content boxes.
Hint: all content boxes are already there, they are just set to display: none at the beginning.
